* Plug
This is a text editor I want to make as a hobby project for me to use on a daily basis and for me to learn aboout framework like SDL3 and more I am very new to this so I will be documenting the whole journey without unhinghed cuts and stuff this is actually going to be my journey of using SDL3.
Hope I can make it as good as I want it to be.

** Libraries I intend to use

- SDL3
- QUICK-UI(An Immediate mode UI library That I built)
- SDL3 Was so much of a pain to use compared to raylib ie I am switching
